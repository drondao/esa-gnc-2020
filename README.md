# esa-gnc-2020
A LaTeX class file for manuscript submission to the **11th International ESA Conference on Guidance, Navigation & Control Systems,
GNC 2020**.  

## What's included?
The class file is ```esagnc.cls```, which inherits from ```article``` and defines all the formatting and functionality 
required for the conference template.

The file ```main.tex``` is an example use of the class file and contains the author instructions from the original MS Word template.

Also included is ```esacit.bst``` bibliography style file, a modification of ```ieeetran.bst```, to comply with the suggested
referencing format.

## Additional information
This LaTeX template has been based on the original MS Word file sent to accepted authors. It is based on the 2020 edition of the conference,
but should be adequate for later years save for minor modifications.
